Working with these files there are a some options on how to see the output.
- Create an index.html file and link the script for each section
- Then run live server from VSCode
- Use the dev console from any browser and and some source scripts to run in the files
- Add the code and then run in the dev console on the script
- Preferred: Use the Quokka.js extension in VSCode (There is a free version that can be used) or purchase the PRO version
- When using the free version and the extension is installed
- The bottom left corner in VSCode there is text reads `Quokka` click on the text
- Click on the purple `Launch Interactive Demo` button
- This opens an interactive demo file, you can delete the contents from the demo file
- Copy the file(s) for each file you are working with
- There are comments to help walk throught the code, but Quokka is amazing as it let's you know what the code is doing 
- (Only JavaScript and TypeScript are supported)
